<h2>I'm Michael and this is a blog about my pet Ball Python, Fox.

<h2> There's a total of 3 snakes in my house. Fox, the male baby
Ball python. Felicia the female Baby Ball Python. And of course,
the mean little Dan, the male Baby Mexican Hognose. </h2>
<br>
<h2>This is Fox, My pet Ball Python. The 2 other snakes mentioned 
belong to my brother. So this blog is centered around Fox.</h2>
